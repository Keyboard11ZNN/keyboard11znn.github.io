============================
Garden of Code Monstrosities
============================

A famous Nietzsche quote goes like this:
   He who fights with monsters should look to it that
   he himself does not become a monster.
   And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.

In order to test this hypothesis, I decided to occasionally realize
one of my code monstrosities for public viewing. If it works, I get more
people like myself to talk to. If it doesn't work, I disprove Nietzsche.
That's what I call a win-win.
