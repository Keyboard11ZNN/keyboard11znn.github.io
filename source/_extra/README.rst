README.rst for built webpage
============================

This webpage is built with Sphinx, and the only system Github provides
at the moment is Jekyll. If you're seeing this in the root of a repo,
you're browsing the branch with the "released" website, not its source code.
Switch to `source` branch to view source, or see Sphinx's source copy directory,
I guess.
