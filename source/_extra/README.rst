README.rst for built webpage
============================

This webpage is built with Sphinx, and the only system Github provides
at the moment is Jekyll. If you're seeing this in the root of a repo,
you're browsing the repo with the "released" website, not its source code.
There is a repo with source code `over here`_ if you need it for anything.

.. _`over here`: https://github.com/stan423321/keyboard11znn
