Whine Cellar
============

Since multiple millenia, the masters of whinemaking are preserving
the sweat juices of complaints, trying to conjure the saltiest whine
possible. Could it lie in this very cellar, among some typewriters
and cogs? Maybe behind one of the dusted cobwebs, or on the broken
wheel?

Given the prices and everything being on offer, this seems unlikely.
But hey, you know what they say about the cheap whine.

Well... at least all that whining is healthier than hydroxymethane.
