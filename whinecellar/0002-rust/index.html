<h1>Stan whines about Rust<a class="headerlink" href="#stan-whines-about-rust" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It’s not something I’ve spent a lot of letters talking about,
but when it comes to programming languages, I have a clear
favorite in C++. But I don’t think it’s perfect, and I may
eventually publish a language of mine that will show some potential
improvement areas. This may seem like a similarly crazy task
as making a competitor to Git from scratch instead of supporting
one of existing alternatives, but guess what: the alternatives
aren’t exactly a net improvement.</p>
<p>There are two programming languages that are trying to position
themselves as potential C++ replacements that I know of, Go and Rust.
Go features mandatory garbage collection, which… you know, at that
point you’re not that far a way from Microsoft’s .NET CLI setup,
that’s nowhere near C++. With Rust, well. It’s definitely more honest.
But it feels… thorny. It’s a Giant, Friendly Yet Clumsy Crab of C++-like
programming languages. I’m not going to pretend I’m a Rust expert;
this post is a rant written mostly after reminding myself Rust exists
and reading through “The Book” on rustlang.org once afterwards.
It’s likely that some points didn’t come through to me, maybe they
could be clarified.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-friendly">
<h2>The Friendly<a class="headerlink" href="#the-friendly" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start by talking about Rust features which I like, and which
I’m definitely considering to include in my language. Many of these
are simply similar to C++ decisions, this includes a static typing
system, equivalents of RAII, presence of object movement… However, it
wouldn’t be fair to assume that “fixing obvious C++ flaws” is where Rust’s
vision of improvement ends. The idea of compiler checking the lifetime
of references seems somewhat obvious in retrospect, but that doesn’t
change usefulness of it. Sometimes it’s interesting to see how some
ideas at C++ Standardization Committee and in Rust are similar and wonder
whether it’s simply convergence, or was there an inspiration going one
way or another, as visible with C++’s std::spans and Rust’s slices as
replacement for pointer arithmetic, or Herb Sutter’s suggested try operator
and Rust’s question mark notation. The non-null notation is cool as well,
though I wonder how well optimized it is - but that’s a rant about
the language, not the compiler.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-giant">
<h2>The Giant<a class="headerlink" href="#the-giant" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some elements of Rust are what I would consider weird, in the sense
that I’m not sure what were the authors thinking when they decided to make
the language work like that, but I don’t really dislike them as much
as I am befuddled by the choices. Usage of postfix exclamation mark
for demarking macros is one example; I have no idea why didn’t they go
with something else, but it’s not ultimately a problem.</p>
<p>A larger feature is lack of direct inheritance, with dataless interfaces
becoming the virtual option vehicles, and in fact apparently vtable
pointers being moved into “fat pointers” within references. I really
don’t know what to think about this. It seems like it would result
in a huge thought paradigm changes and this wasn’t particularly
well explained in the book, aside from “Go also does this and massive OOP
is bad”. There’s probably a point in suggesting use of interfaces instead of
inheritance when separate interface facility is available, but this doesn’t
leave much space for framework objects; maybe they can work differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-clumsy">
<h2>The Clumsy<a class="headerlink" href="#the-clumsy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There’s a few details that I’m not a huge fan of, but which I find ultimately
understandable. All aspects of the Cargo build system feel more like something
made because all the other “cool” languages have their own build systems
which work similarly.</p>
<p>One thing that I want to focus on is lack of what I call “open typing”.
To the best of my knowledge no widely known statically typed language made
it work yet, it’s probably what one could call a “personal concept”.
I mention it since multiple impl blocks for structs are the first step
towards that, and I was feeling a little teased about the possibility
of doing the same thing with fields - but, it’s not what I could really
call a fault.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-crab">
<h2>The Crab<a class="headerlink" href="#the-crab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So I sounded pretty happy with Rust so far. What’s the problem with it, then?</p>
<p>Notation.</p>
<p>Oh dear Lord, the notation.</p>
<p>This is actually a bit of a multifaceted issue. Let me explain.</p>
<div class="section" id="move-by-default">
<h3>Move by default<a class="headerlink" href="#move-by-default" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You know how people criticize C++ for deeply copying stuff all the time
by default? Well, Java’s take on it was to involve a garbage collector
and require explicit cloning of the values half the time. Rust is aligned
to my interests enough to not involve a garbage collector, but deep
copying of things still requires clone annotations. Instead, values
are now moved by default, and proceed to disappear. This is slightly
less of an issue than it sounds like since Rust encourages you to use
references a lot, but it’s a huge gotcha, especially since it doesn’t
apply to some types while applying to others.</p>
<p>But if you’re using references for your function parameters:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reffed-up">
<h3>Reffed up<a class="headerlink" href="#reffed-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You need an ampersand to convert an object to a reference.</p>
<p>If you come to Rust without going through C++ it’s possible that you are
squinting right now. So let’s move straight to the next point:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-vocabulary-problem">
<h3>A vocabulary problem<a class="headerlink" href="#a-vocabulary-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Rust terminology is in significant collision with C++ one.
Given the amount of programming languages, that wasn’t completely
avoidable, but some of the choices are extremely confusing.
The best example is aforementioned reference, which is more like
a C++ pointer than like a C++ reference in many ways. The Rust team
could have tried to find a less used word for such an important element
of the language, like they did with traits - there is a thing called
a trait in C++, but it’s significantly harder to mix up with the Rust one
than the reference. Imagine if it was called a concept or an interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="let-mut-revenge">
<h3>let mut revenge<a class="headerlink" href="#let-mut-revenge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rust has decided to make its equivalent of const object less verbose.
That’s cool, given how cool const objects are in C++, and how Rust boosts
their optimization potential by involving something similar to the C “restrict”
business in its references. Unfortunately, the way they did it is simply
taking the pain on all the non-const stuff by requiring a “mut” qualifier
on it. Then, presumably due to the aforementioned “restrict” business,
you have to reapply that keyword in parameter passes or it will go const
again. Gently nudging me with a fork when I do a shadier thing instead of
when I do a less shady thing still makes me angry about the fork, you know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="generics-traits-and-betrayal">
<h3>Generics, traits, and betrayal<a class="headerlink" href="#generics-traits-and-betrayal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rust has a thing called a “trait” which is somewhere between a Java interface
and C++-Wait-For-It-Edition concepts. Rust also has a thing called a generic
which is supposed to work mostly like a C++ template. Unfortunately, while
C++ Standards Committee decided to, at the last minute, pull concepts out
of C++-Eventually-2011 due to how they required every template user to keep
updating the bureaucratic declarations of conformance with concepts, Rust
authors decided they were mostly fine with it, and in fact they forced generic
authors to force their users to do it. In this case, C++ took… a while
to come up with a suitable replacement, but the new concepts, in spite of the
obvious handicaps, are a drastic improvement.</p>
<p>What is particularly hilarious is that Rust compiler comes with the ability
of automatically making methods for some of the base traits, but you still
have to tell it to do it in all cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="absenceof-improvementof-sigils">
<h3>absenceOf::improvementOf&lt;sigils&gt;<a class="headerlink" href="#absenceof-improvementof-sigils" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I have no idea how one must feel in order to copy the triangle brackets
and the namespace operator, of all things, from C++. Why? Just… why?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-crab-flips-me-on-my-back">
<h2>The Crab Flips Me On My Back<a class="headerlink" href="#the-crab-flips-me-on-my-back" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point, Mozilla has an existing Rust codebase and I doubt they
would be particularly receptive to suggestions of changing half of their
language by one guy with no experience. Certain elements could probably
be adapted out without much damage to existing code, but they like it as is.
I guess if I get less lazy I’ll roll out my own language over LLVM and we’ll
see how that goes. Maybe I’ll even change my viewpoint on some of these.</p>
